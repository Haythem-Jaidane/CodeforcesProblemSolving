## Who's Opposite

a cerculair graph of even noeud numbered clockwise starting from 1 to n the user give you a and b to opposed noeud and c one noeud and you should return the opposed if it exist or return -1

to solve this problem we must de declare to variable 

**NumberOfItem :** is the number of the noeud in the cercle
**Step :** is the number of the noeud between to opposed noeud

in the geometrie two opposed point in cercle is destanced by half parametre of the cercle so the step is the deference absolute value of a and b. NumberOfItem is step*2

this the algorithme to solve problem
